## An introduction of my research question
Recent studies indicate that corporations with high Institutional ownership have higher stock prices than those with less Institutional ownership. Even small companies with high Institutional ownership have higher stock prices in their range. Institutions have researchers and analysts to investigate the financials and the industry potential of the firms. As a result, the perception is that high institutional ownership indicates good value. This study investigates if the percentage of institutional ownership directly correlates with the price of stocks.

## A scope that explains the intended analysis and resulting visualizations for your project
I am planning to collect top-10 stocks with high and low percentage of Institutional holdings and study those stocks performance compared to Index performance for the past 3 years. Planning to visualize price comparison  time series charts. Impact of trade volume on the price. Impact of stock fundamentals on the price

I would like to see if Institutional Investor or Mutual Funds have a say on the stock price. Also i want to see how stocks with high instiutional holdings  fares against low institutional holding stocks in the past 10 years. Performance of those stocks compared to S&P 500 Index in the US.
